# HCR

HCR is a simple Redis compatible distributed session cache based on Hazelcast.

HCR uses Hazelcast in memory data grid to create a distributed hash map to store 
key value data, primarily intended for use as session cache.  All keys in HCR 
have a fixed TLL and will (by default) be evicted if they are unused for 1 hour.

HCR implements the Redis Serialisation Protocol so that off the shelf Redis 
clients can connect to it. It deliberately implements a very small number of 
Redis commands.

Any data stored into HCR will be synchronously replicated to 1 node.  It will be 
asynchronously replicated to at most 2 nodes.  HCR does not persist anything to 
durable storage, it is explicitly an in memory cache.

## Supported Commands

### `SET <key> <value>`

Store the given data under the given key in HCR.  Currently the `EX`, `PX` and 
`NX` options supported by Redis will be accepted but ignored.

### `GET <key>`

Retrieve the value for the given key.

### `DEl <key>`

Remove the given key from HCR.

### `KEYS`

List all keys currently stored in HCR.

### `INFO`

Display information about the HCR cluster

### `COMMAND`

List all available commands.

### `QUIT`

Politely close this connection

## Running HCQ

HCR can easily be deployed as a Docker container:

    #> docker run bergamotmonitoring/hcr:0.0.1

This will start an instance of HCR, listening on the Docker networking bridge.  
If you start a second container, the two will see each other a form a cluster:

    #> docker run bergamotmonitoring/hcr:0.0.1

You can connect to the cluster as follows:

    #> redis-cli -h 172.17.0.2
    172.17.0.2:6379> INFO
